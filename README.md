# Minesweeper Game

This is a classic Minesweeper game built from scratch using C++ and Qt. You left-click to reveal tiles, right-click to mark suspected mines, and try to clear the board without hitting one. The first click is always safe, and if a tile has no nearby mines, it auto-reveals surrounding spaces. Simple concept, just like the original.
